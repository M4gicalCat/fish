# FISH
This [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw) inspired me to do this project from scratch

Fishes follow simple rules:
- They can't stop moving
- If they cross path with another fish, they turn to avoid that happening
- They can't turn too much at once
- Turning make them slow down otherwise they accelerate until a maximum speed is reached

# Installation

- Clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/M4gicalCat/fish.git
```
- Serve the files and open the `index.html` in a web browser. Using [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) is recommended, but right-click => open in browser should work as well.

# Settings
Have fun tweaking the params in `params.js`, you might get specific behaviours using different settings.
